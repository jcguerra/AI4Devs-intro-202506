# String Reverser Web Tool
We are developing a lightweight web application that allows users to reverse any input string in real time.

## Technology stack:
- HTML5
- Javascript
- CSS

## Objects
- We are going to create an index.html file for the UI and a file called script.js for the logic, also add a css file to give the css styles to the UI to make it look simple and minimalistic.
- In the index.html file you are going to place the title “Reverse String”, below a text field for the user to add the text string, below a button called “Reverse” containing an icon referring to the reverse action, and below display the result of the text string in an HTML p-element.
- In the script.js file add the necessary logic to reverse the input text and display the result in the UI.
- When typing more than 3 letters in the input the Reverse button must appear in the UI, otherwise it must be hidden.
- The result must be shown in real time, as you type the text in the input you must see the result.
